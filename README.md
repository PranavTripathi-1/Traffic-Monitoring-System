# Traffic Monitoring System
 This is my B.Tech. third year project on a Traffic Monitoring System using Python-OpenCV and YOLOv8.  
 Real-Time Traffic Optimization Using AI
This project demonstrates how an AI system can analyze traffic data from various sources, predict traffic patterns, and optimize traffic light timings to ensure smoother traffic flow in real time.

Key Features
Data Collection: Collects traffic data from cameras, sensors, and GPS devices.
Traffic Prediction: Uses machine learning models to predict traffic patterns based on historical and real-time data.
Dynamic Traffic Light Control: Adjusts traffic signals in real time to reduce congestion and improve flow.
System Workflow
Input Data Sources:

Cameras: Live video feeds to detect vehicle density and pedestrian activity.
Sensors: Embedded road sensors to monitor vehicle count and speed.
GPS Devices: Vehicle location and movement data from navigation systems.
Data Analysis:

Processes input data using computer vision (for camera feeds) and IoT integration (for sensors).
Applies data-cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure reliability.
Traffic Pattern Prediction:

Employs predictive algorithms (e.g., regression models, neural networks) trained on historical traffic data.
Real-time anomaly detection (e.g., accidents or construction zones).
Traffic Light Optimization:

Decision-making engine dynamically adjusts traffic light durations.
Uses reinforcement learning to optimize for minimal congestion and maximal throughput.
Feedback Loop:

Continuously refines predictions and traffic management strategies using real-time feedback.
Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
AI/ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
